My name is Tom Keim and I'm a data engineer and enthousiast at Info Support. I mostly work at data projects with technologies like Microsoft SQL Server, Power BI, Databricks, Azure Data Factory and most other Azure data products. In my free time I like to spend time with my wife and two kids. Also I like to watch a lot of TV Shows &amp;amp; Movies or spent time on home automation with products like Home Assistant and ESPHome.</description></item></channel></rss>
